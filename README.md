# App-Inventor-Project-Math-for-Early-Childhood-Education
Idea developed by me and Jhullya Soares Martins, a student of Computer Engineering. We have been developing the entire project for three months during the "Girls Programming" extension, taught by Luciana Montera Cheung, at UFMS. With the support of MIT's App Inventor tool, it consists of an application full of educational games, which aims to make math learning much more fun.

We are working in some features, but we hope that soon we will be able to develop it in a less limited tool, since the App Inventor may have some bugs depending on the device using the app's .apk.

How do I open the AIA file?
You can open AIA files in MIT App Inventor (Web). To do so, select Projects → Import project from my computer.... Then, when the Import Project... window appears, browse to and open your .AIA file.

An .AIA file is a Zip-compressed project file created by MIT App Inventor, a web program used to teach beginning developers to create Android and iOS applications. It contains multiple folders and files, including .BKY, .SCM, and .YAIL source code files. .AIA files are used to save backups of App Inventor projects and share them with other users.
